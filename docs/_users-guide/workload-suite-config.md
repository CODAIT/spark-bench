title: Workload-Suite Configuration
---

Workload suites are exactly what they sound like. They are logical groups of workloads.
Workload suites can be composed with each other for benchmarking tasks or to simulate different cluster use cases.

## Parameters

| Name    | Required | Description |  
| ---------- | ----- | --- |    
| benchmark-output | no | path to the file where benchmark results should be stored, or use `"console"` to print to the terminal |
| descr | yes | Human-readable string description of what the suite intends to do |
| parallel  | no | Whether the workloads in the suite run serially or in parallel. Defaults to `false`. |  
| repeat  | no | How many times the workloads in the suite should be repeated. |  

## benchmark-output

Control where results are outputted by using `benchmark-output`. While each workload can output the results of its particular algorithm
using the configurable parameter `workload` within a workload block, `benchmark-output` collects the _benchmark results_ in one place.

For example, in the following configuration, the contents of `output` will be the dataset generated by running the query over in the input. 
The contents of `benchmark-output` will be one single line containing the _timing results_ of the sql run.
```hocon
workload-suites = [
  {
    descr = "One run of a SQL query"
    benchmark-output = "hdfs:///tmp/sql-benchmark-results.csv"
    workloads = [
      {
        name = "sql"
        input = "/tmp/generated-kmeans-data.parquet"
        output = "/tmp/sql-query-results.parquet"
        query = "select `0` from input where `0` < -0.9"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
_Omitting `benchmark-output` will prevent benchmark results from being written._ For example, this will run the same workloads
as above but the benchmark results will not be written, but the workload output will be written.
```hocon
workload-suites = [
  {
    descr = "One run of a SQL query with no benchmark result output"
    workloads = [
      {
        name = "sql"
        input = "/tmp/generated-kmeans-data.parquet"
        output = "/tmp/sql-query-results.parquet"
        query = "select `0` from input where `0` < -0.9"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## descr

`descr` is simply a human-readable string that gets added to benchmark results.

## parallel

The parameter `parallel` is a boolean that controls whether the workloads within the suite run serially or are launched in parallel.
The default is `false`, meaning that workloads will run serially by default.

## repeat

`repeat` controls how many times the _suite_ repeats. 
For example, say a suite contains the workloads A, B, a different instance of B, and C.
Let's also say it's running serially, and repeat is 2.
This setup will run like this:
```text
A
B
B
C
---
A
B
B
C
---
Done
``` 
And it will NOT run like this:
```text 
// Will NOT run like this!
A
A
--
B
B
--
B
B
--
C
C
---
Done
```
