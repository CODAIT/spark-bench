title: SQL
---

Runs a SQL query over the input dataset. `input` from the common parameters is required.

The query string is required to use "input" as the name of the table. For example:
```sql
select * from input where SomeNumericField < 15
```

You can also query unnamed columns such as those generated by the KMeans data generator, as in this example from the SQL Workload unit test
which uses \`0\` as the name of the first column, \`1\` as the name of the second, and so on.
```sql
select `0` from input where `0` < -0.9
```

#### Parameters

| Name        | Required | Default  | Description |
| ----------- |---------------| ---------| ------------|
| name        | yes      | -- | "sql" |
| input       | yes      | -- | the input dataset |
| output      | no       | -- | If users wish to capture the actual results of the SQL query, they can specify an output file here. |
| queryStr    | yes      | --    | the sql query to perform. The table name must be "input" as shown in the examples above. |
| cache       | no       | false | whether the dataset should be cached after being read from disk |

#### Examples

```hocon
{
  name = "sql"
  input = "/tmp/generated-kmeans-data.parquet"
  output = "/tmp/sql-query-results.parquet"
  queryStr = "select `0` from input where `0` < -0.9"
}
```

```hocon
{
  name = "sql"
  input = "/tmp/generated-kmeans-data.parquet"
  queryStr = "select `0` from input where `0` < -0.9"
  cache = true
}
